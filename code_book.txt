=================
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals timeAccelerometerXYZ and timeGyroscopeXYZ. These time domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (timeBodyAccelerometerXYZ and timeGravityAcclerometerXYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (timeBodyAccelerometerJerkXYZ and timeBodyGyroscopeJerkXYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (timeBodyAccelerometerMagnitude, timeGravityAccelerometerMagnitude, timeBodyAccelerometerJerkMagnitude, timeBodyGyroscopeMagnitude, timeBodyGyroscopeJerkMagnitude). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing frequencyBodyAccelerometerXYZ, frequencyBodyAccelerometerJerkXYZ, frequencyBodyGyroscopeXYZ, frequencyBodyAccelerometerJerkMagnitude, frequencyBodyGyroscoopeMagnitude, frequencyBodyGyroscopeJerkMagnitude.  
These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:  Mean and Standard Deviation.

==========================================

 
The cleaned data set were created from the following raw data sets:

- 'features.txt': List of all features.
- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
- 'test/subject_test.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

===========================================

The processes are described:

First of all, training and test data sets (X_train.txt, X_test.txt) were combined. And the column names are imported from features.txt. Secondly, only columns of mean and standard deviation for each measurement were kept. Thirdly, subject identifiers were written in from subject_train.txt and subject_test.txt. Activity labels were merged in the data from y_train.txt and y_test.txt and matched with activity names from activity_labels.txt. Lastly column names were tidied. The final data set is 

'testtrain.txt'

A second tidy data was also created. Rows in ‘testset.csv’ were grouped by 6 activities and 30 subjects. The variables in ‘testset.csv’ were averaged in the 180 groups. The second tidy data is 

'AvgSubjectActivity.txt'
